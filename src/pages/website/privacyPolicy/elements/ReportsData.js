        <h6>Termination</h6>
        <p style={{marginTop: '20px'}}>
          <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(a)</span>The Contract comes into effect on the date You agree to subscribe as a Merchant and shall continue indefinitely until such time as the Contract terminated in accordance with this Clause 6.
        </p>
        <p style={{marginTop: '20px'}}>
          <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(b)</span> Bogo may terminate the Contract upon written notice as follows:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(i) </span>immediately in the event that You become insolvent, are put into liquidation or receivership or have an administrator appointed;
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(ii) </span>upon 5 working days notice in the event You commit a material breach of these Ts &amp; Cs, and for this purpose a material breach will be deemed to have been committed if you have not paid any amount due within 30 days of the date of the invoice; or
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(iii)</span> upon 30 days notice for any reason, and Bogo need not provide a reason in the event of termination under this Sub-Clause.

        <p />
        <p style={{marginTop: '20px'}}>
          <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(c)</span>  You may terminate these Ts &amp; Cs upon giving 30 days written notice by You for any reason.

          <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(d) </span>Upon the termination of the Contract for whatever reason, all right and obligations will cease immediately other than those which are expressed to survive the termination of the Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination is without prejudice to whatever rights and obligations arose prior to the date of termination of the Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts which were due and payable before and up until the date of termination of the Contract shall remain due and payable by the Merchant.
        </p>
        <p style={{marginTop: '20px'}}>
          <span style={{fontWeight: 'bolder'}}>(e)</span> Notwithstanding this Clause 6, each of Bogo and You are excused from delays in fulfilling their obligations under these Ts &amp; Cs for a period of a maximum of 30 days in the event the specific obligation or act is prevented as a result of an event of force majeure, and then only strictly to the extent such obligation or act is actually so prevented. Where either Bogo or You is claiming a force majeure event is preventing performance under these Ts &amp; Cs must use all reasonable efforts to find alternative means for satisfying the obligation under the Agreement. Neither You nor Bogo can terminate the Contract solely by reason of a breach which is being caused because of a permitted force majeure event, provided that the relevant obligation or act is fulfilled or performed immediately performance is possible. For the purposes of this Clause, and act of force majeure is strictly limited to an ‘act of god”, including but not limited to storm or other severe weather incident, flood, fire, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, war, riot, act of terrorism, epidemic or pandemic or any other event which is severe, beyond the control of both parties and was not reasonably foreseeable.
